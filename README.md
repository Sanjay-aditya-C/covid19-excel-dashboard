# COVID-19 Analysis & Prediction Dashboard using Excel

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a COVID-19 analysis and prediction dashboard using Microsoft Excel. 
The objective is to transform raw COVID-19 data into meaningful and easy-to-understand insights through 
data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The dashboard highlights key COVID-19 metrics such as 
confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases in a clear and professional format.

This project represents my first step into the field of data analytics and demonstrates my ability 
to work with real-world data using Excel.

## Problem Statement
COVID-19 datasets are often large and complex, making it difficult to quickly understand trends 
and patterns from raw data. There is a need for a simple, visual, and interactive dashboard that 
summarizes key metrics and helps users analyze the overall impact of the pandemic.
